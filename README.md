# 🎯 Student Accommodation Safety Platform

A production-quality full-stack web application designed to ensure safety and transparency in student accommodations (Hostels, PGs, Private Student Housing).

This platform enables **verified students** to report safety issues securely, helps future students make informed decisions, and creates accountability for accommodation providers.

## 🚀 Why This Platform Exists

Students often choose accommodation based on:
- Fake or manipulated online reviews
- Broker influence
- Misleading advertisements
- Lack of verified safety data

This leads to real-world risks:
- Food poisoning incidents
- Poor sanitation
- Unsafe infrastructure
- Security threats
- Water quality issues

This platform introduces **verified, accountable, student-driven safety intelligence**.

- Password Hashing using bcrypt
- Role-Based User System (Student / Owner / Admin)
- Protected API Routes
- Profile Management with Password Change
- OTP Email Verification
- Forgot Password with OTP Reset

- Student verifies fix ("Yes, Issue is Fixed") or disputes ("No, Issue Persists")
- Admin can reopen disputed reports for owner to retry
- Trust score updates dynamically based on resolution outcomes
- 6 Report Statuses: Pending → Approved → Resolved → Verified / Disputed / Rejected
- In-Page Resolution Modal (Owner can resolve directly from accommodation detail)

### 🗺️ Interactive Map with Location Search
- OpenStreetMap Integration with colored safety markers
- 🟢 Green = Safe (Trust Score ≥ 80)
- 🟡 Yellow = Caution (Trust Score 50-79)
- 🔴 Red = Unsafe (Trust Score < 50)
- Location Search Bar (Search any city, area, landmark)
- GPS "My Location" Button for nearby accommodation discovery
- Radius Filter (2km, 5km, 10km, 20km, 50km)
